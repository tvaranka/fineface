## Environment setup
```bash
```
## Running inference
```python
```

## What are Action Units (AUs)?
- Action Units are movements of facial muscles that are identified and used to break down facial expressions, like raising inner eyebrows (AU1).
- By mixing different AUs, it is possible to create complex facial expressions, with each AU adding its own unique intensity.
- See below for a quick overview.
